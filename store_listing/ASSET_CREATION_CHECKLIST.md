# Asset Creation Checklist for CountScore

Complete checklist for creating all visual assets needed for Google Play Store publication.

**Last Updated**: 2026-09-20
**Status Tracking**: Use this document to track your progress

**The palette is not repeated here.** The brand colours live in `lib/utils/app_theme.dart` —
`kBrandSeedLight` `#0E8F88` (the teal), `kBrandSeedDark` `#5ED8CF`, `kLeaderGold` `#F2B705` —
and the icon's ground is the ink `#0E1716`. Read them there; a hex copied into a document
goes stale the day the theme moves.

## Overview

**Required Assets**:
1. App Icon (512×512) - REQUIRED
2. Feature Graphic (1024×500) - REQUIRED
3. Screenshots (2-8 phone screenshots) - REQUIRED

**Timeline Estimate**: 3-6 hours total

---

## Phase 1: Preparation (30 minutes)

### Setup Checklist

- [ ] **Review all documentation**
  - [ ] Read `ASSET_REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - [ ] Read `SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md`
  - [ ] Read the palette in `lib/utils/app_theme.dart`

- [ ] **Gather resources**
  - [ ] Choose design tool (Figma, Canva, GIMP, etc.)
  - [ ] Install tool if needed
  - [ ] Read the hex codes off `lib/utils/app_theme.dart`, never off a document

- [ ] **Understand app colors**
  - [ ] Primary: brand teal (`kBrandSeedLight`, #0E8F88)
  - [ ] Leader gold (`kLeaderGold`, #F2B705); the icon's ground is ink #0E1716
  - [ ] Style: Material Design 3

- [ ] **Review existing app icon**
  - Location: `store_listing/assets/icon_512.png`, generated from `design/icon/`
  - [ ] Viewed current icon

---

## Phase 2: App Icon Creation (1-2 hours)

> **The icon is generated, not drawn by hand.** `scripts/generate_icons.py` writes every
> size — the launcher, the PWA, the in-app asset and `store_listing/assets/icon_512.png` —
> from the vector source in `design/icon/`. Its constraints and the regeneration command are
> `.llmwiki/Release.md` §Icons. This phase applies only to a redesign of that source.

- [ ] **Design validation**
  - [ ] Works on light backgrounds
  - [ ] Works on dark backgrounds
  - [ ] Recognizable at 48×48px
  - [ ] No text too small to read
  - [ ] Professional appearance

### Technical Checklist

## Phase 3: Feature Graphic Creation (1-2 hours)

> `--check` verifies the committed PNG still matches. This phase applies to a new design.
