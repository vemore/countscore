## How to Use

### 3. Upload to Play Console

In Google Play Console:

**Store Presence > Main store listing**:

2. Short description: Copy from `short_description.txt`
3. Full description: Copy from `full_description.txt`
4. App icon: Upload `assets/icon_512.png`

## Localization (Future)

To add support for additional languages, create new directories:

```
store_listing/
├── en-US/           # English (United States)
├── es-ES/           # Spanish (Spain)
├── fr-FR/           # French (France)
├── de-DE/           # German (Germany)
└── ...
```

Each language directory should contain:
- title.txt
- short_description.txt
- full_description.txt
- release_notes_vX.X.X.txt

Screenshots can be reused or localized as needed.
